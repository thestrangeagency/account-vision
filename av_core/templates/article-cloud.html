{% block title %}Storing and Sending Client Files? This Is Why a Cloud Computing Solution Is So Important{% endblock %}

{% block body %}
<p>Running an accounting business means juggling a wide variety of different files and documents&nbsp;—and doing so&nbsp;securely, effectively, and efficiently. This has always proven to be something of a headache when relying on traditional structures, which can be unreliable and insecure.</p>
<p>But there has been a revolution in the ways in which we approach file storage and transfer&nbsp;—&nbsp;and this revolution is the cloud. Here's why you need a cloud computing solution when you send and store client files.</p>

<h3 class="h3">Eliminate the Cost of Hardware</h3>
<p>With no need to purchase or rent servers, or invest in any other of the storage hardware associated with physical file storage and sharing, a cloud solution is likely to save you a significant amount of money.</p>

<p>Maintaining physical servers requires a lot of time and effort, which can be effectively saved if you opt for a cloud solution.</p>

<p>Searching through a physical hard drive can be time consuming, and it also seriously throttles the computing power of the device you are using. Searching through email, on the other hand, is completely unreliable and can result in files going missing altogether. Cloud solutions eliminate this issue.</p>

<h3 class="h3">Free Up Hard Drive Space</h3>
<p>Hard drive space is limited. Don't waste it by relying on physical file storage, when a cloud or hybrid model can provide the solution you need.</p>

<h3 class="h3">Enjoy Additionally Secure Back Up from Data Center</h3>
<p>If you choose the right cloud solution provider, all of your files will be backed up in a data center, protecting you from any power outages or crashed hard drives. To put it simply, your data is safe.</p>

<p>With the right cloud solution, you will be able to quickly and effectively share your files on an organization-wide basis. This means you will benefit from enhanced mobility as well as high-level collaboration&nbsp;—&nbsp;two elements that are critical to modern accountancy.</p>

<h3 class="h3">Access to Master Copies for all Files</h3>
<p>Save a master copy of the file in the cloud and enable collaborative editing in real time. This secures full reliability and ensures everyone is working from the same page.</p>

<h3 class="h3">Encryption on Stored Files</h3>
<p>Security is vital, both for regulatory compliance and also for the reputation you present to your clients. Encryption delivered by a cloud solution is ideal for achieving this.</p>

<h3 class="h3">Regular Security Auditing and Upgrades</h3>
<p>You need to make sure that you are operating with the best, most efficient software available to you. This means undergoing regular security auditing and upgrades&nbsp;—&nbsp;something that is automatic with an effective cloud solution.</p>

<h3 class="h3">Two-Factor Authorization for Additional Peace of Mind</h3>
<p>It pays to ensure maximum security and reliability when it comes to file storage and transfer, which is why the two-factor authorization offered by a cloud solution is such a valuable feature.</p>
