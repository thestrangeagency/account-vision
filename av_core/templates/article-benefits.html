  The Benefits of Client Portal Software for Accountants
{% endblock %}

{% block body %}
  <p>In an increasingly digitized marketplace, client portals represent a vital point of connection for the modern
    accountant. This is the channel via which you will communicate with your clients, via which you will conduct a
    substantial portion of your business, and via which you will build fruitful relationships going forward.</p>
  <p>In short, client portal software is not something which can be overlooked. While many web hosting services will
    provide client portals with their website packages, these will very often be limited. Accountants are better
    served by investing in a piece of portal software which directly serves their needs.</p>
  <p>Take a look at some of the benefits of using the right piece of client portal software below:</p>
  <h2 class="h3">Agility Through Quick Communication</h2>
  <p>Let's imagine that you need to get in touch with a client, urgently. Not only this, but you need to get in touch
    and transfer files that need to be signed off by your client. In fact, this is not something that you need to
    imagine; this is something of a regular occurrence for most accountants.</p>
  <p>Achieving this in a traditional manner means deploying different methods of communication alongside each other. A
    telephone call to inform the client of the situation, an email or Dropbox transfer of documents, the physical
    signing of documents, and then another email or document transfer. Each fault in this network of connections is a
    potential weak point.</p>
  <p>Portal software eliminates this by putting everything together in one platform, including the e-signing and
    returning of documents. With no weak points and a far more effective system of communication, accountants will
    find their businesses far more agile, and more ready to meet the challenges of an evolving&nbsp;market.</p>
  <h2 class="h3">Longer Lasting Relationships with Clients</h2>
  <p>A successful accountancy business depends on nurturing relationships. You certainly want to expand by bringing
    new clients in, but you also want to secure long-term value from existing clients. How is this achieved? Through
    communication and knowledge.</p>
  <p>Client portal software represents a direct access point to both of these important concepts. Communication is one
    of the fundamental tenets of relationship-building and the portal is a platform for doing just that. What's more,
    a client wants to feel that you know them and have their best interests at heart. The portal puts all the
    resources you need to achieve this right at your fingertips.</p>
  <h2 class="h3">A Better Understanding of Client Needs</h2>
  <p>But understanding goes further than simply getting to know your client. Clients come to you to benefit from your
    expertise and industry knowledge, and to achieve solutions which they are not able to achieve themselves.</p>
  <p>The client portal stores a record of client histories and interactions, creating a resource which you and your
    team can tap into any time you need. This delivers you a better understanding of the needs of your client and
    positions you to go above and beyond those needs.</p>
  <h2 class="h3">Further Flexibility Through Remote Team Structures</h2>
  <p>By deploying your client portal via web-based or cloud structures, you will be able to give remote teams access
    to all of the resources and functionality that the client portal entails. This further contributes to the
    flexibility of your business, enabling you to connect with the benefits of remote teams while remaining on track
    for meeting your clients' diverse needs.</p>
