{% block title %}The The Drawbacks of Email: Why the Tried and Tested Communication System Might Not be so Reliable{% endblock %}

{% block body %}
<p>Email might be considered something of a precursor to cloud technology. The concept of 'emailing something to ourselves' so that we can remotely access it later on is similar to the fundamental tenets of cloud computing as it existed&nbsp;in its early stages, and email remains a useful communication tool for a variety of reasons.</p>
<p>But, it is far from perfect. In fact, for an accountancy firm, relying on email communication structures could be putting your business at risk. Read on to discover more about the drawbacks of email when compared to a more modern, more reliable, cloud solution.</p>

<h3 class="h3">Substandard Security</h3>
<p>Considering how much we rely upon our email providers, it may be worrying to learn that the medium and its associated platforms are&nbsp;not secure. In fact, hackers can easily snoop on our email traffic if encryption is not deployed, which is seriously scary if you are sending sensitive documents, data, or passwords to clients.</p>

<h3 class="h3">Malicious&nbsp;Links Can, and Do, Get Through</h3>
<p>We consider ourselves to be smart and savvy, never falling for phishing scams or other malicious communications. However, the fact of the matter is, if these links are landing in our inbox, then we are exposed to them. Think how many times a dodgy email has broken through your security protocols; each of these instances represents a risk.</p>

<h3 class="h3">Files Tend to Get Lost in a Sea of Messages</h3>
<p>Once a file is received via email it is handily stored on the email server. This means, should you be out of office and unable to access your physical storage structures, the file will be there waiting for you in your email account. But we are too reliant on this, and, when we are receiving messages every hour of every day, it is all too easy for files to become lost.</p>

<h3 class="h3">No Easy Way to Share Organization-wide Communications</h3>
<p>Emails are great for when you need to send a quick communication to one or two people, or even to a small group, but what about for organization-wide notices and communications? These tend to be somewhat trickier to achieve, and most email platforms simply do not offer this kind of functionality in any sort of effective manner.</p>

<h3 class="h3">Cumbersome and Unreliable Reviewing</h3>
<p>As an accountant, you frequently need to view communications between you and a client for a single tax year. In the mess of an email inbox, this is very difficult to accomplish, and you may end up missing highly important communications as a result. In fact, it is difficult even to review a reliable list of communications from a single client at all, even before time parameters are factored in.</p>

<h3 class="h3">High Levels of Spam</h3>
<p>Even with a spam filter in place, it is likely that these unwanted communications are still going to get through. At their best, they are an inconvenience, wasting your time as you sift through them. At their worst, they are downright dangerous, carrying all manner of nefarious links and softwares.</p>
<p>So, what is the alternative? A cloud-based messaging system provides a far more effective means of communicating with your clients than traditional email, easily and effectively sorting your messages across different clients and different tax years, and keeping everything secure with HTTPS. Two factor authorization provides an additional level of security.</p>
